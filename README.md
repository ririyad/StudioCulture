# Studio Culture

*Disclaimer: Yet to write*


Studio Culture is a repository about a specification what a studio should looks like, feels like. This specification will describe every small things about the environment of a ideal studio. I have to admit that my bias for creating this studio will mostly focus on **Software Development** and may be extended for other fields. This studio spec will recommend about a environment that provide support of:
- Deep Work 
- Minimalism
- Flow of Work
